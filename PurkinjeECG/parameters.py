    """Class to specify the parameters of the fractal tree.
            
    Attributes:
        meshfile (str): path and filename to obj file name.
        filename (str): name of the output files.
        init_node (numpy array): the first node of the tree.
        second_node (numpy array): this point is only used to calculate the initial direction of the tree and is not included in the tree. Please avoid selecting nodes that are connected to the init_node by a single edge in the mesh, because it causes numerical issues.
        init_length (float): length of the first branch.
        N_it (int): number of generations of branches.
        length (float): average lenght of the branches in the tree.
        std_length (float): standard deviation of the length. Set to zero to avoid random lengths.
        min_length (float): minimum length of the branches. To avoid randomly generated negative lengths.
        branch_angle (float): angle with respect to the direction of the previous branch and the new branch.
        w (float): repulsivity parameter.
        l_segment (float): length of the segments that compose one branch (approximately, because the lenght of the branch is random). It can be interpreted as the element length in a finite element mesh.
        Fascicles (bool): include one or more straigth branches with different lengths and angles from the initial branch. It is motivated by the fascicles of the left ventricle. 
        fascicles_angles (list): angles with respect to the initial branches of the fascicles. Include one per fascicle to include.
        fascicles_length (list): length  of the fascicles. Include one per fascicle to include. The size must match the size of fascicles_angles.
        save (bool): save text files containing the nodes, the connectivity and end nodes of the tree.
        save_paraview (bool): save a .vtu paraview file. The tvtk module must be installed.
